# Useful Features
* You do not have to type and execute commands in turn.<br>You can specify them by a list - divide by two ampersands (&&).
* The console has its own memory - a buffer with the last few commands.<br>They can be moved with up and down arrow keys.
* To avoid typing the name of a file or folder completely,<br>you can type the first name characters and double-click Tab.<br>If the file or folder is in the current directory,<br>the command line will add the path itself.
